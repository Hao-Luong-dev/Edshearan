            <p>Ed Sheeran is a singer/songwriter who was born in Halifax, England but was raised in Suffolk, England.
               He’s known for his energetic live shows, which involve him using a loop pedal and sometimes throwing some
               raps
               in for good measure.

            <p>Ed’s success story began with him playing music in older people’s homes. He first was picked up by a
               record
               producer when busking in the USA. He performed nearly a thousand gigs and street performances before
               getting
               the recognition he deserved. Unsigned projects such as Loose Change and Songs I Wrote with Amy relied on
               the
               production of long-term collaborator Jake Gosling and signaled the start of their hugely successful
               musical
               relationship. Soon he’d made countless industry friends. Teaming up with some of the biggest names in UK
               grime
               – Wiley, Ghetts, Jme and more – he released the No. 5 Collaborations Project in January 2011, and it
               reached
               number 46 on the UK Singles Chart. One of the songs, “Little Lady” (feat. Mikill Pane), was a fan
               favourite,
               so Ed made a more radio-friendly solo version entitled “The A Team” and the rest is history. The song now
               has
               over a million sales in the UK and two million in the US.</p>
            <p> Picked up by Asylum/Atlantic Records, Sheeran released another single entitled “You Need Me, I Don’t
               Need
               You.” He released his debut album + in September 2011, to great critical acclaim. It topped the UK Albums
               Chart and has sold nearly two million copies in the UK alone. Many successful singles, features, and an
               EP
               with Yelawolf later, Ed scored his first UK #1 with the Pharrell Williams-produced “Sing”. Then came his
               7x
               Platinum sophomore album x, which features a slew of hugely successful singles including “Don’t”,
               “Thinking
               Out Loud” and “Bloodstream”.</p>
